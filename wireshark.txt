==========Daytime=============

1. 

1 192.168.219.128 129.6.15.28 TCP 76 60634 -> 13 [SYN}
2 129.6.15.28 192.168.219.128 TCP 62 13 -> 60634 [SYN, ACK]
3 192.168.219.128 129.6.15.28 TCP 56 60634 -> 13 [ACK]

2. The TCP connection is sent over port 13 to the NIST server and received back on port 60634

3. The client needs a port to recieve information back from the server since the handshake goes both ways

4. 4 129.6.15.28 192.168.219.128 DAYTIME 107 DAYTIME Response

5. [SYN] is how a client or server reaches out to establish a connection and make a request. [ACK] is the aknowledgement that the request has been recieved

6. The client initiated the closing of the TCP connection by sending [FIN] to the server

==========Http==============

1. There are two 3-way handshakes with [SYN], [SYN, ACK], and [SYN] so two  connections are created

2. The frame below requests the index.html page

=========Questions===========

What does the [PSH, ACK] tag mean?

When I accidentally opened an https connection there was no [FIN] tag at the end but there is when I open an http connection. Is there a reason for this or was the tag just hidden when I connected to https
